                            <li>Almost 1 in 10 people in the UK hasnâ€™t recycled or upcycled a single item in the past year</li>
                            <li>Approximately 100 million pounds of clothing is produced every year statewide.</li>
                            <li>Approximately 0.02 pounds of pesticides are used to produce one pound of new clothes, approximately 2 million pounds of insecticides washed into waterways or otherwise harm the environment.</li>
                            <li>Approximately 3-4 pounds of CO2 are saved for every 1 pound of clothing that is spared from disposal.</li>
                            <li>We can save 300-400 million tons of CO2 from entering the atmosphere for every 100 million tons collected annually. This is the equivalent of taking 26,000-35,000 cars off the road (According to the U.S. EPA, a passenger car emits about 11,450 pounds of CO2 a year on average).</li>
                            <li>Only about 9% of the 350 trillion tons of plastic the world manufactures a year is recycled.</li>
                            <li>Now globally, 2.12 billion tons of waste is dumped annually.</li>
                            <li>According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 292 million tons of municipal solid waste was generated in 2018. Of this total only 94 million tons was recycled, 25 million tons was composted, and another 17 million tons of food was managed with other methods. That still leaves a whopping 152 million tons of waste in the landfills generating greenhouse gases as they slowly break down, and increasing plastic pollution in the environment.</li>
                            <li>According to the EPA, in 2019 the industry sector produced 23% of carbon emissions in the processing of raw materials into a finished product.</li>
                            <li>Globally, about 85% of clothes ends up in landfills or burned.</li>
                            <li>An estimated 13 million tons of textile waste a year comes from the manufacturers themselves, as well as retailers with the fashion industry contributing roughly 10% of all global carbon emissions and with plastic fibers in the clothes contributing to microplastic pollution.</li>
